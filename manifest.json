    "description": "This extension enables you to check off items on the calendar page of Canvas by instructure. In Canvas, the calendar tab is a powerful tool to manage workload and anxiety, but there are times when items have a due date, but no way to mark as complete. For me, it really bothered me so I decided to make this extension and I plan to develop it further as well.  ",
